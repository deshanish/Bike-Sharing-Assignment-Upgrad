- What is the dataset that is being used?

The company, BoomBikes, is trying to understand the factors which affect the demand for shared bikes after the Covid epidemic. After facing huge losses they want to enter the market after performing the due analysis and have a focused approach to the business. The management wants to understand how exactly the demand varies across the various features. In addition to understanding the current market this model will also help them to enter new markets  in a more focused & a profitable way. 

The dataset that we are using is 'day.csv' file. 

I have used the Recursive Feature Elimination method to solve the above problem. 


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1  - It is seen that the feel temperature, atemp, is the variable that highly affects the decision to rent shared bikes. 
- Conclusion 2  - The weather also plays a major part in the decision making where Summer and Fall seasons are mostly prefered by the                           customers for renting bikes. 
- Conclusion 3  - It is also seen that the maximum renting of bikes happened in the year 2019.
